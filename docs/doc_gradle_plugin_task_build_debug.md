# Gradle Task: Build Debug

This task builds the KMP library, renames the created .aar file to kmp.aar and copies
it from my-project/kmp/common/build/outputs/aar to root-project/.klutter folder so that
the android/app build.gradle can include this .aar file as a local dependency. Note: This build.gradle
file is generated by Klutter. For more information see [task 'generate adapter'](doc_gradle_plugin_task_generate_adapter.md) for how the build.gradle is generated.

Building the KMP library should also generate a .podspec file, which the iOS module will depend on.
See before mentioned chapter [task 'generate adapter'](doc_gradle_plugin_task_generate_adapter.md) for 
how Klutter ensures the iOS module can find the .podspec.

Next the Pods and Podfile.lock in my-project/ios are deleted and Pod update is executed to retrieve the newly created
podspec. The deletion is necessary to be sure the new podspec is used.
Klutter will output all logging from the dependend tasks. Always check the log to see if the build was succesfull.

Finally the app can be run for iOS and/or Android by running the lib/main.dart file on an emulator/simulator.
