# Klutter

Klutter is a framework and tool set which uses Flutter to create the frontend
and Kotlin Multiplatform for the backend. The connective layer is generated
by the Klutter framework. Klutter combines industry best practices
for everything from app design to CICD into a single cohesive framework.

# Klutter is in PRE-ALPHA stage!

## Project structure

A typical project structure is as below. For the simplest example see project [example-basic](example-basic)

```
project
└───android [1]
└───assets [2]
└───ios [3]
└───klutter [4]
└───kmp [5]
└───lib [6]
│   build.gradle.kts [7]
│   settings.gradle.kts [8] 
│   pubspec.yaml [9] 
```

1. Android module (flutter).
2. Shared assets module containing both iOS and Android app + metadata resources including images, i18n/i10n etc.
3. IOS module (flutter).
4. Klutter module containing build.gradle.kts with configured Klutter plugin(s) and .yaml files for app + project configuration.
5. KMP module containing the Kotlin Multiplatform backend.
6. Lib module containing the app frontend (flutter).
7. Project build.gradle.kts which adds the Klutter plugins to the classpath.
8. Project settings.gradle.kts to include Kotlin module: Klutter, KMP and Android
9. Pubspec.yaml (flutter)

## Klutter Plugin

### Task: synchronize
The synchronize task takes all yaml files in the klutter directory, merges them and creates 2 files: 
- klutter.gradle.kts
- klutter.properties

These files are created in the klutter/.klutter directory. Any existing klutter.gradle.kts or
klutter.properties file in this directory will be overwritten. Do <b>not</b> manually edit these files!
Next the plugin will find all modules configured by the Klutter Plugin. A .klutter directory
with klutter.gradle.kts and klutter.properties will be created in each module. 

#### Setup modules
Example of a modules block:

```kotlin
    modules {
        module("kmp")
        module("kmp/common")
        module("android")
        module("android/app")
        module("klutter")
    }
```

By default each module will be resolved by Gradle rootProject directory e.g. if 
the klutter plugin is configured in build.gradle.kts file in directory 
"C:/Users/Anakin/MyProject/fancyapp/klutter" then module("kmp") 
will be resolved to the absolute path "C:/Users/Anakin/MyProject/fancyapp/kmp".

This behavior can be overwritten for either the entire modules block or separately 
per module. Set the root of the project by using the root function. This will result 
in an absolute path e.g. module("kmp") will be resolved to the absolute path "foo/bar/kmp".

```kotlin
    modules {
        root("foo/bar")
        module("kmp")
    }
```

Specifying absolute paths is however most of the times not the way to go. It can cause
issues when absolute paths are checked into version control. What works on your machine
won't work on someone elses if the repository is checked out in a different directory.
Therefore it is recommended to use a relative path by setting the 'absolute' parameter 
to 'false'.  

```kotlin
    modules {
        root("../../foo/bar", absolute = false)
        module("kmp")
    }
```

If the klutter plugin is configured in build.gradle.kts file in directory
"C:/Users/Anakin/MyProject/fancyapp/klutter" then setting the root this way will
resolve module("kmp") to the absolute path "C:/Users/Anakin/foo/bar/kmp".

#### Use configuration
Because the synchronize task adds the generated configuration files to each module,
using it is as easy as applying the klutter.gradle.kts file:

```kotlin
apply(from = ".klutter/klutter.gradle.kts")
```

An idiomatic Kotlin way of applying and using the generated klutter.gradle.kts file is 
by using the .also function:

```kotlin
buildscript {
    apply(from = ".klutter/klutter.gradle.kts").also {
        repositories {
            maven {
                url = uri(project.extra["privateRepoUrl"] as String)
                credentials {
                    username = project.extra["privateRepoUsername"] as String
                    password = project.extra["privateRepoPassword"] as String
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

When it's not possible to apply the klutter.gradle.kts file then the klutter.properties
file can be read directly. The synchronization task will keep both files in sync so they
will always contain the same properties. As an example the gradle files in de android 
folder are generated by Klutter and use the klutter.properties file instead of the klutter.gradle.kts
file like so:

```groovy

def kProps = new Properties()
   new File(project.projectDir, ".klutter/klutter.properties")
           .getCanonicalFile()
           .withReader('UTF-8') { reader -> kProps.load(reader)}

    repositories {
        maven {
            url = uri(kProps.getProperty('private.repo.url'))
            credentials {
                username = kProps.getProperty('private.repo.username')
                password = kProps.getProperty('private.repo.password')
            }
        }
    }

```
