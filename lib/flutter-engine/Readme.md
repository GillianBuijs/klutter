# Flutter Engine

This module contains a few helper methods to reduced boilerplate code generation in a consumer flutter project.
**Important:** Any change in this module requires a rebuild of the xcframework. This framework should be copied 
to the klutter-dart project, which will add the xcframework when generating a new project.
